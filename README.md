# Prokopec *et al.*'s microarrays evaluating gene expression in the liver after exposure to TCDD
In Prokopec *et al.*'s **Comparative toxicoproteogenomics of mouse and rat liver identifies TCDD-resistance genes**, the authors produced a set of microarrays testing the gene expression of C57BL/6 and DBA mice to different doses of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-*p*-dioxin (5 -or 500 Âµg/kg TCDD) or corn oil vehicle *in vivo* 19 hours post-exposure.
